# challenge-unit-2

## Description

This repo is the second challenge assignment of the GA Tech Coding Bootcamp course. It is the first assignment that required me to create the entire webpage from scratch and do my best to emulate the provided mock up. It is an online portfolio with filler photos for now, but I indend to update this webpage and eventually use it as an accurate portfolio. 

## Challenges

The most challenging aspect for me was getting the images resized and correctly positioned with CSS. Although, I was able to get the images sized correctly, I am still working on getting them correctly positioned, and will revise the webpage when I am able.
